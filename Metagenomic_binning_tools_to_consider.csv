First, all scaffolds are broken into 5 kb segments called data points, and the properties of each data point are computed. The binning process begins with a single bin that contains all scaffolds and proceeds by iteratively splitting this and subsequent bins. All non-final bins are evaluated during each iteration. The algorithm searches for a single value for one of the characteristics that will result in the best separation of the scaffolds into two bins. Separation quality is calculated based on the number of data points that were assigned correctly given the separation of the scaffolds. Once a split has been made, scaffolds are separated into the bin with the majority of the data points representing the scaffold. Bins are approved if the quality score exceeds a predefined threshold, and both bins consist of at least 50 data points. A bin is considered final if no separation can be made; otherwise, it undergoes further rounds of binning."

METAMVGL applies a multi-view label propagation algorithm [18] to learn the weights of assembly and PE graphs automatically and predict the unlabeled contigs in a uniformed framework. We remove the ambiguous labels for two times before and after label propagation.

SemiBin uses k=4 (also used in other tools18,19,20,21,22), so the dimension of K is 136 (k-mers that are the reverse complement of each other are considered equivalent). K-mer vectors are normalized by the lengths of each contig after the addition of a small pseudo-count. SemiBin uses taxonomic annotation results to generate cannot-link constraints and breaks up contigs to build must-link constraints. By default, MMseqs245,46 (version 13.45111, default parameters) is used to annotate contigs with GTDB28 reference genomes. We used a semi-supervised siamese neural network. The binning problem is modeled as clustering on a graph. First, SemiBin considers the fully connected graph with contigs as nodes and similarity between contigs (1 - Euclidean distance of the semi-supervised embedding) as the weight of edges. Infomap (python-igraph package58, version 0.9.7), an information-theory-based algorithm to reveal community structure in weighted graphs29, is used to reconstruct bins from the graph. "

At the first layer, k-mer frequencies and coverages of all contigs are merged together as inputs to the GPU-based modified DPGMM for preliminary clustering, which can dynamically dissolve small clusters and reassign contigs to the remaining clusters to avoid over-segmentation. We monitor the average Euclidian distance of pairwise k-mer frequencies within each cluster and discard the abnormal clusters (see the “Methods” section). Each preliminary cluster derived from the DPGMM is involved in the second layer to be further clustered, which comprises two major models modeling k-mer frequencies and coverages, respectively. Firstly, semi-supervised k-mer frequency probabilistic model is trained by an elaborated seed selection model on the basis of the single-copy marker genes, and then predicts the classification probabilities (Supplementary Fig. S1), which are passed as priors to the coverage probabilistic model. Secondly, a modified multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) models the coverages combined with the adaptive priors to cluster the contigs using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Clusters with an estimated genome number of one are output. The remaining contigs will continue to the next iteration. The iterations will stop until all contigs are consumed."

The advantage of clustering embeddings instead of the original features is that these embeddings are of a smaller dimension and can encode relationships that are latent in the original features. We improve upon existing binners by incorporating the assembly graph into the training process. The assembly graph describes which contigs are connected, and how many reads support that connection (read coverage). We use this information to train a GNN, and generate embeddings that take into account the neighborhood of a contig. We have adapted the GraphSAGE sampling algorithm to make better use of the assembly graph information."

Hi-C technique generates millions of paired-end reads linking DNA fragments in close proximity within cells and has already been utilized to explore topologically associated domains and the compartment property of the mammalian genomes [16, 17]. Hi-C paired-end reads were aligned to assembled contigs. Raw contig-contig interactions were aggregated as contacts by counting the number of alignments bridging two contigs [42]. As contacts reflect the proximity extent between contigs, only pairs of Hi-C reads aligned to different contigs were retained to generate the contact maps. The coverage of contigs was computed using MetaBAT2 (v2.12.1) [12, 33] script: “jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths.” HiCzin was used to normalise the raw contact maps by the length and coverage of contigs.

The masked regions are ignored during the k-mer frequency calculation. binny uses two contig features for dimensionality reduction and clustering: the k-mer frequencies of multiple sizes (default k = 2, 3 and 4) and the average read coverage (raw read counts of one or more samples), both centered log-ratio transformed. To reduce the dimensionality of all features to two, the Fast Fourier Transform-accelerated Interpolation-based t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding implementation of openTSNE [43] is used. To decrease the computation time of the dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis is used beforehand to lower the dimensionality of the initial feature matrix to either as many dimensions needed to explain 75% of the variation or to a maximum of 75 dimensions. binny uses hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) [48] on the generated two-dimensional embedding, in iterations. binny will run clustering of the created embedding n times (default 3), each time extracting MAGs meeting the quality thresholds and continuing with the embedding containing only the leftover contigs."

SemiBin2 uses the same approach as SemiBin1 to generate must-link constraints. For the generation of cannot-link constraints, SemiBin2 uses a self-supervised approach, randomly sampling pairs of contigs and treating them as cannot-link pairs. Then, SemiBin2 uses a deep siamese neural network (Chopra et al. 2005) to implement a contrastive learning method and learns a better embedding from the must-link and cannot-link constraints. The inputs to the neural network are the features computed from the contigs, while its outputs are the fixed dimensional embedding. After obtaining the contig embeddings from the deep learning model, a clustering algorithm is used to obtain the final bins. For short-read data, SemiBin2 uses the same clustering method used in SemiBin1. For long-read data, SemiBin2 employs an ensemble-based DBSCAN algorithm to bin contigs."

Similar to SolidBin [38] and COCACOLA [34], we utilized the set of single-copy genes universal for bacteria and archaea provided by [13] to estimate the number of genomes in the metagenomic data. In summary, four binning results are generated for each feature matrix. Three of them are from the “partial seed” method, and one is from regular k-means++. Since there are three feature matrices (comp, cov, combo) for each dataset, twelve binning results are generated for the next step. Split bins with high contamination according to the single-copy genes. First, the bins with high bin scores estimated by the SCGs for bacterial and archaeal genomes will be selected. Then, the contigs in the selected bins will be removed from other bins. The above two operations are repeated until there are no high-quality bins. In the second stage, we integrated the three ensemble results of the first stage, as shown in Fig. 3. First, Binning_refiner is applied directly to refine bins generated from the first stage to produce bins with low contamination levels as done in MetaWRAP. Then, the same method as the first stage is used for selecting high-quality bins."

After training, two sets of contig clusters will be generated, one set from continuous latent space (z clusters) and another set from the categorical latent space (y clusters). The z space is clustered using the clustering algorithm of VAMB14. The y clusters are implicit from the one-hot categorical latent space and can simply be extracted as the categorical vector. Therefore, all contigs are present twice, both in the y and z output. The two sets were then split by sample of origin to per sample-specific bins using the principle of multi-split binning from the VAMB framework. Finally, the bins were filtered based on CheckM218 scores and then de-replicated."
